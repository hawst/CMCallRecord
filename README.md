# CMCallRecord
[Xposed module] Call recording module on CyanogenMod 11/12/12.1

This module is based on EnableCMCallRecording by pylerSM. 
Original codes there - https://github.com/pylerSM/EnableCMCallRecording
Just for a case i has forked it - https://github.com/hawst/EnableCMCallRecording

I was little bit changed module 
- migrated to use Android-Studio
- rollback codes to handle audio source 
(original repo somehow that codes was removed by last commits)

Tested on Samsung Galaxy S5 Duos (G900FD) with CM12.1
